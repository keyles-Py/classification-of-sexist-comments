# Classification-of-sexist-comments
This repository contains the final project for the Artificial Intelligence course at the University of Magdalena. The goal of this project is to classify sexist comments into four categories using various machine learning algorithms.

<h1>Project Description</h1>
In this project, we implemented a comment classification system trained on a dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dataset contains labeled sexist comments, and the objective is to accurately categorize them into predefined classes.

We experimented with several machine learning algorithms to compare their performance:

Linear Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Neural Network (MLP)
<h1>Dataset</h1>

Description: Contains labeled comments classified into four categories:

Threats, harm plans, and incitement

Derogation

Animosity

Prejudiced discussions
